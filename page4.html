                TFT has a bunch of different strategies that are used, with many different playstyles and different compositions that make a strong team.

                Two of the main strategies that are often seen are rerolling for 3 stars, or going to level 8-9 and starring up high cost units. These often make up the majority of comps in the game, being simple to play.

                One other strategy that is sometimes good is a flexible comp, in which you play less around getting all champions of a given class or origin, and instead play around core units that you get earlier.

                Common trait strategies are playing for verticals, in which you build a bunch of units of a given class or origin, to give all of them a team-wide bonus.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="wrapper content">
            <p>
                Some other strategies are playing towards smaller amounts of different traits, and getting stronger units that will not rely on these traits.
            </p>
        </div>

                Currently, the recent strategies that are often played are reroll comps, which build into verticals to give your 3 stars more power.
