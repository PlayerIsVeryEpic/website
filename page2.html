                TFT has a simple yet complex item system, with many different items to choose from, and unique abilities for each item.

                Getting components to create these items come from the carousels, as well as the creep rounds that happen at the end of every stage.

                Components can also come from the different starting encounters, as well as from your augments.

                Each item usually has a class associated with it, which can be viewed by looking at a champion with the designated class. However, there are a few special items that are do not have any associated class.

                These items are artifacts and emblems, with each providing different bonuses to your units and team. Artifacts are not craftable, and emblems require a rare special component to create.

        <div class="wrapper content">
            <p>
                Artifacts come from special augments, trait cashouts, or the starting encounters. These items provide huge bonuses to your units, and are almost always better than regular items. However, these are hard to come by, you won't be seeing them every game.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="wrapper content">
            <p>
                Emblems are items that give a unit a designated trait based on the emblem. This is helpful, because if you have a unit that doesn't fit into a certain trait, you can get an emblem and give it the trait.
