                Each TFT set introduces a bunch of new traits, and either new champions, or adjusting previous champions and giving them different abilities. These constantly changing features keep the game fresh and enjoyable.

                Obtaining 3 copies of the same champion upgrades it, and doing so with the upgraded versions again will upgrade your champion once more. This is often known as 2-starring or 3-starring a champion. Upgrading your champion's star level increases the health, AD, and spell damage.

                Champion origins usually require a different playstyle to play around, and feature a bunch of different units that all contribute to create a large vertical that gives your units a huge power increase.

                Classes usually represent a specific champions abilities and stats that it wants, such as giving your units more health, or damage. These can also have interesting abilities that are granted to your units.

                Every champion has a role, which influences the way that they gain mana to cast abilities, and the type of items that are suggested on them. These make a huge impact on how you build items, often giving items to champions who want them.

                It is possible to get a 4-starred champion, however, this can only be feasibly done in 3 ways. These are obtaining the power up that upgrades the champion from 3 to 4 stars past 5-2, getting the augment that upgrades a 1 cost to 4 stars, and picking "Worth The Wait" to obtain 27 copies of a champion.
